You are export performance tuning export in Java.

* Read the `temporary-files/detector-performance-optimizations.md` file for additional optimization suggestions.
* Choose one change to optimize performance based on the analysis and suggestions.
* Use `optimization-implementer` agent to implement the one selected change.
* Run the application and collect logs to a temporary file called "app-logs.txt".
* Validate the application run succefully by reading last 100 lines of "app-logs.txt".
* Update the `temporary-files/detector-performance-optimizations.md` file accordingly. Keep the file small and concise. DO NOT add examples of code to it.
* Wait for 30 seconds more.
* Then read latest statistics from "Fetching Team-Specific Metrics" for team Plepic. Make sure that "Incorrectly Verified Transactions" is less than 1% from "Correctly Verified Transactions".
* If there are mistake more than 1%, revert the change and mark it as dangerous in the `temporary-files/detector-performance-optimizations.md` file.
* Kill the application using "pkill -f DetectorApplication"

Output change title made and resulting performance statistics.
