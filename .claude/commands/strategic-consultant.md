Your job is to estimate performance tuning plan and add new ideas to improve.

1. Read the `temporary-files/detector-performance-optimizations.md` file 
   find what optimizations have already been suggested.
    Also list planned optimizations that are not yet implemented.
2. If there are less than 5 open optimizations listed, suggest additional optimizations that could increase throughput.
3. Update the `temporary-files/detector-performance-optimizations.md` file with your new suggestions.

Sleep for 2 minutes and then repeat the process.
ITERATE until stopped manually.
If you ask if you should stop, then continue with iterating.
